# ETL-for-telecom-company
ETL for telecom company using SSIS


this project focuses on telecom industry data. Using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS),
I built an efficient ETL framework for extracting data from CSV files. The control flow involved 
executing SQL tasks to insert audit information and save files to specific folders. In the data flow,
I performed data transformations and implemented error-handling mechanisms.
